# Pill-Dispenser


The Pill Dispenser is a machine that can release the right medicine, at the correct dosage, at the right time and frequency. Then turn on an alarm, which notifies the user about taking his medication. This machine will also have the ability to inform and alarm the patient's family and friends to make sure that the patient takes his medicine. The device is fully automated and programmable. Alarms and schedules can be set by the end-user using a user-friendly keypad. 

A video demonstration on the user interface can be seen here:
